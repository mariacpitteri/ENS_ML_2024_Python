# Machine Learning for Cognitive Sciences: Tutorials & Exam

This repository contains my tutorials and final exam for the Master's module **Machine Learning for Cognitive Sciences: Principles and Applications** at *Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure (ENS)*.

The module focused on neural data analysis and introduced computational tools to model and interpret such data using machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

Throughout the course, we explored a variety of foundational and advanced modeling techniques, including:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Maximum Entropy Models**
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**  
  - Includes an implementation of the **Viterbi Algorithm**

These tools were applied in the context of understanding neural data and cognitive processes.
